# Fruit and Vegetable Prices
---

## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to generate insights into the sales performance of fruits and vegetables over the past year. By analyzing various parameters from data provided by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS), which estimates average prices for over 150 commonly consumed fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, we seek to gather sufficient insights to make informed decisions. This analysis will enable us to tell compelling stories through our data insights, addressing questions such as:

  - How much do fruits and vegetables cost?
  
  - Reported estimates include each productâ€™s average retail price and price per edible cup equivalent (the unit of measurement for Federal recommendations for fruit and vegetable consumption).
    
  - Average retail prices are reported per pound or pint.

## Data Source

The primary data sources are MS Excel, with open-source data freely downloadable from repositories such as 

  - Kaggle
  
  - FRED
  
  -   or the USDA ERS website [download here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/fruit-and-vegetable-prices.aspx)

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

The data cleaning and preparation process involves several steps, including:
1.	Data loading and inspection
2.	Handling missing variables
3.	Data cleaning and formatting

## Data Tools Used
The major tools used for the analysis include:

  - MS Excel [download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
    
  - Microsoft Power BI
    
  - 	Google Sheets
    
  - 	Google software

These tools are essential for pivoting and analyzing the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This phase involves exploring the data to answer key questions, such as:

  - What is the overall sales trend?
  
  - Top 5 fruits by retail price)
  
  - Which products are top sellers? (Top 10 fruits by cup equivalent price)
  
  - Total form yield
  
  - Bottom 5 forms by cup equivalent price
  
  - What are the products with peak sales? (Report of fruit by yield)

## Data Analysis

This section includes basic lines of code or queries, as well as DAX expressions used during the analysis. For example:

```
SQL

SELECT FROM TABLE 1
