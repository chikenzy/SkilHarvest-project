# Fruit and Vegetable Prices
---

## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to generate insights into the sales performance of fruits and vegetables over the past year. By analyzing various parameters from data provided by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS), which estimates average prices for over 150 commonly consumed fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, we seek to gather sufficient insights to make informed decisions. This analysis will enable us to tell compelling stories through our data insights, addressing questions such as:

  - How much do fruits and vegetables cost?
  
  - Reported estimates include each productâ€™s average retail price and price per edible cup equivalent (the unit of measurement for Federal recommendations for fruit and vegetable consumption).
    
  - Average retail prices are reported per pound or pint.
